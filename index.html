<p class="title">&nbsp; &nbsp;Dear, President Jim Yong Kim:</p>
	<center>
	<p class="paragraph">It’s a pleasure to be writing to you today, President Jim Yong Kim. My name is Daniel Lloyd Hawke and I am an 8th grade student at the International School of Manila. I have spent the last four to five weeks researching poverty and its relationship with modern slavery. This has been brought to my attention throughout the things I see everyday in this country. I believe that what I’ve learnt must be shared and solved with care. Now that I’ve introduced myself, let’s begin with the global overview of poverty and slavery.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Poverty and Slavery. Two very different issues that are interconnected by their causes. No matter how many times the problem of poverty is addressed, the issue still remains at large. Same goes for slavery. Some causes for slavery include the unequal statuses that women have and being vulnerable in poverty (Stroede). Vulnerability is the dominating factor connecting slavery with poverty. Poverty has women and children out in the open, whether to be kidnapped, raped, or kept as a slave. This is what vulnerability in poverty tolls on them. This is why I am writing this letter, because there is an available scenario to kill two birds with one stone. If a main cause of slavery is the vulnerability in poverty, then you have to kill the root of that cause. Therefore, we need to ensure the people of poverty a shelter, enough food, water and a life. Throughout the world right now, there are 20 to 30 million slaves (“Modern Day Slavery”). This statistic angers people, but nobody sees slavery everywhere. People see poverty everywhere, leading people to think poverty is more important. This is immensely incorrect, because you are more likely to be hit by lightning than going to jail for owning a slave (“Modern Day Slavery”). 

 </p>
 <p class="paragraph">This must open the eyes of disbelievers on how there needs to an effort focused into finding the owners who encourage slavery to prosper. This letter will be situated on the concerns of how poverty impacts women and children’s ability to avoid slavery.
  </p></center>

	<center><p class="paragraph"> The best way to solve poverty-caused slavery is to educate, feed and give (healthcare, shelter, safety) to the vulnerable people in poverty to avoid vulnerability to slavery in poverty. This will be achieved with the EASY (Educate, Act/Aid, Save and Yield) Program. The EASY Program will focus on main causes of poverty and ease the struggle of poverty and slavery by educating, acting/aiding, saving and yielding. Educating can open the eyes of people in poverty about slavery, and Acting/aiding can Save the people who are already too far into poverty or slavery and finally the program will Yield the actions taken when acting, saving and educating take place. This program will Yield healthcare, shelter, safety and education to fulfill the EASY promise. This solution is most effective because a major cause of slavery is the vulnerability of people who are under the poverty threshold (Stroede). The E in EASY stands for educate, which UNICEF has said is the strongest key to protect children from poverty (“Goal: Eradicate Extreme”). 
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph"> UNICEF also provides health care, clean water, education, immunizations and other services. The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1990 (“United Nations Millennium”). According to the data provided if the EASY Program provides education services, health services to those vulnerable in poverty, it will benefit them. The countries will need to scale up the current investment they have dedicated to education. Consequently, justifying that the program will fulfill the A in EASY, Act/Aim. The EASY Program will create health services towards those who need health care to prevent them from becoming desperate, leading them to slavery. UNICEF may have set a goal to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and that may leave people a little too hopeful. However, the EASY Program promises to reveal the truth of how long it would take to truly eradicate the problem. Although hope is key to reaching a goal, we think people would rather have the truth. The program will Save and Yield to those already too far into poverty or slavery, by feeding them and caring for them. With the programs that will develop, feeding or educating jobs will be given to those unemployed in underdeveloped countries.

<h3>Inspirations for the EASY Program Solution:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.thefreedomproject.org" target="_blank"/>The Freedom Project</a> <h4>THE FREEDOM PROJECT EXISTS TO END CHILD HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY</h4>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.unicef.org/" target="_blank"/>UNICEF</a> <h4>FOR EVERY CHILD, A FUTURE. ACROSS 190 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, UNICEF DEFENDS THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN</h4> 
  </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.adb.org/" target="_blank"/>ADB (Asian Development Bank)</a> <h4>THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AIMS FOR AN ASIA AND PACIFIC FREE FROM POVERTY</h4>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"/>The World Bank</a> <h4>THE WORLD BANK GROUP HAS TWO GOALS, TO END EXTREME POVERTY AND PROMOTE SHARED PROSPERITY IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY</h4>
  </li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="paragraph">Now, it is time for action, not addressing or spreading awareness, but it is time for the A in EASY, Act/Aim. In Latin America & Caribbean there are 70.5 million people in poverty and 320.6 million people in poverty in East Asia & the pacific as of 2013. South Asia has 854.1 million people in poverty and Sub-Saharan Africa has 616.3 million people in poverty as of 2013 (“Poverty and Equity Database”). If South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have such a great amount of their population vulnerable in poverty, then this program should be based in the underdeveloped countries in that region. This must be proposed in meetings like the Annual Meeting of IMF and The World Bank Group. The World Bank need to fund and construct all structures, advisors and concepts mentioned in the EASY Program. 

</p> 
<p class="paragraph">There has only been a good outcome seen in Ghana from all of Africa with the school feeding program which is now seen in 4,700 schools all over Ghana (“Ending Poverty in”). A solution only working in one country of all the 54 countries in Africa enforced by the World Bank. Though this feeding program was a very smart and enforced project, it needs to be improved if clear benefits are only seen in one country. This leaves an opportunity for the EASY program to take over. The EASY Program will avoid this by not establishing the feeding stations in schools, but in poverty areas of underdeveloped countries. The program will continue to exist in, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic, Niger and Malawi. In South Asia, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<p class="paragraph">United Nations states that poverty is causing $150 billion a year to be earned from modern slavery, trafficking and forced labor (Besheer). With all the research only an idiot wouldn’t see that extreme poverty is what makes people vulnerable to slavery, not the other way around. Now, the solution is clear, if you end or decrease extreme poverty then slavery will trail with it (Marinelli). To summarize, for the EASY Program to triumph, education services, healthcare services, rescue teams and feeding stations must prevail. This must occur in the poverty active areas of Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Niger, Malawi, South Asia, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. This Program is especially concerned for women and children, thus they must be targeted first.</p>
<p class="paragraph">No matter the commitment and desire in seeing children and women thrive out of poverty and slavery, it won’t be enough to cover the costs. That’s why this is directed towards you, the President of the World Bank, if you believe in the EASY Program then the countries will too. Working together will fulfill the financial need to have this program succeed. With this program introduced and the World Bank working with it step by step, the world will truly believe they still have a chance. A chance that the promise of equality is to be granted to the innocent people left desperate.
 </p>
<p class="paragraph">I would like to thank you for spending time reading this letter. I dearly have faith in you considering this as a step to take to abolish the problem of poverty and slavery. May the eradication of slavery and poverty transpire flourishingly.

<h5>SOLUTION RATIONALE PARAGRAPH:</h5>
<p class="paragraph">The best way to solve poverty-caused slavery is to educate, feed and give (healthcare, shelter, safety) to the vulnerable people in poverty with the EASY (Educate, Act/Aid, Save & Yield) Program. The EASY Program will benefit all vulnerable people in slavery and poverty because the program will educate, act/aid, save and yield to those that need it the most. UNICEF also provides health care, clean water, education, immunizations and other services. The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1990 (“United Nations Millennium”). This evidence proves that educating, providing health care and rescue teams is the most desirable and most advantageous way to decrease the population of victims of poverty and slavery. </p>
<p class="paragraph">The World Bank attempted to heal poverty and hunger around Africa with feeding programs, but only provided a nutritious meal for children in Ghana. There has only been a good outcome seen in Ghana from all of Africa with the school feeding program which is now seen in 4,700 schools all over Ghana. This gives the 1,700,000 students/children a lunch fulfilling all their nutritious needs (“Ending Poverty in”). This evidence signifies the importance of expanding a program to affect as many people as possible. The EASY Program will provide health services, education, feeding programs and rescue teams to the defenseless sufferers of slavery and poverty. It will follow the successful education given by UNICEF, and improve the feeding programs from the World Bank. President Jim Yong Kim, you must fund this program, propose it and enforce it throughout meetings and with members of the World Bank Group.
